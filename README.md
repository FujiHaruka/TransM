# TransM

TransM is a translation assistant tool for Markdown document.

## Installation

You need Deno before installing this tool.

Then, you can install TransM CLI.

```
$ deno install --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/transm/transm.ts
```

## Getting Started

Let's start translation with a simple markdown text (`example.md`) as below:

```markdown
# Title

* item1
* item2
```

The command `$ transm new` creates a markdown file for translation from a target file.

```
$ transm new example.md translation.md
```

The file `translation.md` generated by the command looks like:

```markdown
<!-- L1..1
# Title
-->

# Title

<!-- L3..4
* item1
* item2
-->

* item1
* item2
```

You can edit `translation.md` as you like except comment blocks, which represent texts and positions of the original file. Suppose the file will be edited as below:

```markdown
<!-- L1..1
# Title
-->

# 表題

<!-- L3..4
* item1
* item2
-->

* 要素1
* 要素2
```

OK. Translation has been done.

But, you might be curious about the case when the original file `example.md` changes. In that case, you can use the command `$ transm update`.

Suppose the `example.md` is edited as below:

```diff
 * item1
 * item2
+* item3
```

The command `$ transm update` updates the translation file following the change of the original file.

```
$ transm update example.md translation.md
```

The file `translation.md` will be updated as below. Notice that the second block is updated.

```markdown
<!-- L1..1
# Title
-->

# 表題

<!-- L3..5
* item1
* item2
* item3
-->

* item1
* item2
* item3
```

You can re-translate the updated text after the `update` command. In this way, TransM supports "continuous translation".
